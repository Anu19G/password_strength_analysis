# Overview

This project explores password creation, evaluation, and security testing through both theoretical and practical approaches.

**Key Activities:**
- Generated strong passwords using Windows PowerShell and Kali Linux tools.
- Evaluated passwords with [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com).
- Improved weaker password to enhance resistance against attacks.
- Simulated **dictionary attacks** with John the Ripper.
- Simulated **brute force attacks** with Hashcat.
- Compared attack results between weak and strong passwords.

**Core Findings:**
- Strong passwords (16+ chars, mixed charset) are highly resistant to common attacks.
- Weak passwords (short, predictable) can be cracked in seconds.
- Complexity and randomness drastically increase attack time.

**Deliverables:**
- PDF reports of password evaluations
- Screenshots of attack simulations
- Comparative analysis table

This work demonstrates the importance of password hygiene and showcases hands-on cybersecurity skills.
